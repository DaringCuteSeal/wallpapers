# Rendering Your Custom Image

All the art here is made with [Blender](https://www.blender.org). I provide .blend files for all the wallpapers here so you can render your own image. You can also learn, remix, or tweak them, if you want.

First, you need to get the corresponding .blend file.  You can either get it directly from GitHub by selecting the correct .blend file, clicking on the *Download* button and saving the file, or cloning my repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DaringCuteSeal/wallpapers.git
```

(**Only if you don't clone my repository and an external resource is required (read the wallpaper's README.md)**) and then, get all the external resources (located on /resources) written on README.md that exists on every single wallpaper directory and place it *relative to the .blend file*. The path should be written on the README. If you encounter magenta-colored lighting/texture, you can change the file path to the correct image.

Lastly, Install [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and run it, open the .blend file, and then change whatever you want and render it. Don't forget to save the image.

You can ask me if you have any question but please search your problem on the web first.
