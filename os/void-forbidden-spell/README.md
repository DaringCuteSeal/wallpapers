Void Linux ([voidlinux.org](https://voidlinux.org))

"Legend says:
In that Void cave, there's a book with a secret spell that allows you to deeply control yourself and the world around you. You'll find a peace with the Universe.
However, you'll never get to escape. Not because there's no way out, but because the spell inside makes you want to stay there, eternally.
Nobody knows what the spell does exactly."
